**Today's Progress**: Updated implementation of deleting Order Items

**Thoughts:** Heads up! I've already started this project last Friday. Since it would be a waste not to continue this and think of new things to implement, I decided to add this as part of the challenge. I guess the learning process would be much more important than the project for this one.

I am slightly getting familiar with the basics of React. Did some refactoring of the delete functionality for the Order items.
