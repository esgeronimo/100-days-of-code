**Today's Progress**: Updated implementation of deleting Order Items

**Thoughts:** Heads up! I've already started this project last Friday. Since it would be a waste not to continue this and think of new things to implement, I decided to add this as part of the challenge. I guess the learning process would be much more important than the project for this one.

I am slightly getting familiar with the basics of React. Did some refactoring of the delete functionality for the Order items.

Next task is to understand how I can implement accessing the page with an initial order item. 

Something like http://ordertaker.com?initOrderId=ABC123.

### Day 1: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated React setup

**Thoughts:** I used the _webapp_ Yeoman generator for this project which does not have React out of the box. I had a hard time looking on how I can add React to the project and it took several errors and investigation to get it done. Later did I know that there is actually a [recipe](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp/blob/master/docs/recipes/react.md) for adding React to this generator. Well I guess that is the better approach so I decided to create a branch and refactor the current setup. 

Another thing. Some of the changes I did yesterday was not pushed to Github. Luckily it is not that big and I was able to retrieve it on my local repo.
